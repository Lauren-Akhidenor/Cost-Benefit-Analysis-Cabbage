# Enhancing Sustainable Cabbage Production through Mycorrhizal Inoculation: A Cost-Benefit Perspective 

----

## **Overview**

This project focuses on evaluating the impact of mycorrhizal fungi application on cabbage (*Brassica oleracea*) cultivation, with an emphasis on both sustainable agriculture and economic feasibility. Cabbage is a key crop in Kenya’s agriculture, contributing to national food security and economic growth. This study explores a biological soil amendment (mycorrhizal inoculant) as a strategy to improve plant growth, resilience, and economic feasibility.

-----

## **Project Aim**


The primary aim of this project is to investigate the agronomic and economic benefits of mycorrhizae fungi inoculation on cabbage plants. The goal is to enhance productivity, resource efficiency, and sustainability in agricultural systems.

-----
## **Objectives**

To evaluate changes in root length, thickness, and biomass resulting from mycorrhizal treatment.

To compare the overall health and growth rate of cabbage plants with and without mycorrhizal treatment.

To perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing mycorrhizae-treated and untreated cabbage crops.

-----

## **Methodology**

### **Experimental Design**
- Treatment Group: Cabbages treated with mycorrhizal inoculant.
- Control Group: Cabbages without inoculant.
- Plots: 10m × 6m area producing 170 cabbage heads per plot.

-----

### **Agronomic Inputs**

- Mycorrhizal Inoculant: Biological soil enhancer.
- Oshothane Ridomil: Fungicide.
- Booster: Foliar nutrient.
- Duduthrin: Pesticide.

## **Key Findings**

Preliminary results revealed a notable increase in root development among mycorrhizae-treated plants, indicating enhanced nutrient absorption and structural stability. Additionally, treated plants displayed improved health scores, darker green foliage, and greater resistance to pests. These findings suggest a potential for greater resilience and productivity under sustainable farming practices.

## **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**

### **Economic Scenarios**
1. Control Group (Without Inoculants): Cabbages grown without mycorrhizal fungi.
2. Treatment Group (With Inoculants): Cabbages treated with mycorrhizal fungi.

------

### **CBA Methodology**
- Input Cost Data: Collected through structured checklists.
- Analysis Tools: Microsoft Excel 2019 for data recording and calculation.
- Key Metrics: 
   - Input Costs: Fertilizers, inoculants, pesticides, labor.
   - Market Value: Price of harvested cabbage.
   - Gross Margin per Square Meter: Profitability analysis.
   - Return on Investment (ROI): Calculation of economic return.

## **Economic Insight**

**Table 1:  Cost of Production for Both Case 1 (Without Mycorrhizal Inoculant) and Case 2 (With Mycorrhizal Inoculant)**

NOTE: 
- When case 1 without mycorrhizal inoculant was sold at Ksh.40 for 1 cabbage amounts to 40 * 170 = Ksh. 6,800 
- For case 2 with mycorrhizal inoculant, the cabbage was sold at ksh.80 for 1 cabbage which amounts to 80*170 = Ksh. 13,600 
- CBR or cost-benefit ratio = Total benefit/  Total cost

**Return On Investment (ROI)**

Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of several different investments. It is calculated as the ratio of profit to total costs, expressed as a percentage. 

The formula for ROI is:

**ROI = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100**

In this study, the **Return on Investment (ROI)** for both scenarios Case 1 (without mycorrhizal inoculant) and Case 2 (with mycorrhizal inoculant) was calculated to compare the economic viability of each farming practice. The ROI is an essential indicator of whether the costs associated with the mycorrhizal treatment yield sufficient economic benefits in terms of profit. 

By calculating the ROI, we can assess the financial effectiveness of using mycorrhizal inoculants as an input in cabbage farming, providing valuable insights for smallholder farmers and policymakers in making cost-effective decisions.




This analysis provides evidence-based recommendations for smallholder farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers by quantifying the trade-offs between upfront input costs and long-term productivity gains. The use of mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated enhanced profitability, improved soil health, and greater resilience—critical components for scaling sustainable agriculture in developing economies.

## **Conclusion**
 
- This project bridges agronomic innovation with economic evaluation
- Demonstrating how biological soil enhancers like mycorrhizal fungi can align with ustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as zero hunger and climate-resilient agriculture.
- By combining empirical plant data with agricultural economic analysis, this study contributes to the growing discourse on low-cost, high-impact interventions for African food systems.
