# Enhancing Sustainable Cabbage Production through Mycorrhizal Inoculation: A Cost-Benefit Analysis

----

## **Overview**

This project evaluates the impact of mycorrhizal fungi application on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) cultivation, emphasizing sustainable agriculture and economic feasibility. Cabbage is a key crop in Kenya, contributing to national food security and economic growth. The study examines biological soil amendments (mycorrhizal inoculants) as a strategy to improve plant growth, resilience, and profitability.

-----

## **Project Aim**

To investigate the agronomic and economic benefits of mycorrhizal fungi inoculation on cabbage, enhancing productivity, resource efficiency, and sustainability in smallholder agricultural systems.

-----
## **Objectives**

- Assess changes in root length, thickness, and biomass due to mycorrhizal treatment.

- Compare plant health and growth rates between treated and untreated cabbage.

- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to evaluate the economic feasibility of mycorrhizal inoculation.
-----

## **Methodology**

### **Experimental Design**
- Treatment Group: Cabbages treated with mycorrhizal inoculant.
- Control Group: Cabbages without inoculant.
- Plots: 10m × 6m area producing 170 cabbage heads per plot.

-----

### **Agronomic Inputs**

- Mycorrhizal Inoculant: Biological soil enhancer.
- Oshothane Ridomil: Fungicide.
- Booster: Foliar nutrient.
- Duduthrin: Pesticide.

## **Key Findings**

- Mycorrhizae-treated plants exhibited improved root development, nutrient absorption, and structural stability.

- Treated plants had higher health scores, darker green foliage, and greater pest resistance.

- Results suggest enhanced resilience and productivity under sustainable farming practices

------

## **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**

### **Economic Scenarios**
1. Control Group (Without Inoculants): Cabbages grown without mycorrhizal fungi.
2. Treatment Group (With Inoculants): Cabbages treated with mycorrhizal fungi.

------

### **CBA Methodology**

- Input Cost Data: Collected through structured checklists.
- Analysis Tools: Microsoft Excel 2019 for data recording and calculation.
  
- Key Metrics: 
   - Input Costs: Fertilizers, inoculants, pesticides, labor.
   - Market Value: Price of harvested cabbage.
   - Gross Margin per Square Meter: Profitability analysis.
   - Return on Investment (ROI): Calculation of economic return.

## **Economic Insight**

NOTE: 
- When case 1 without mycorrhizal inoculant was sold at Ksh.40 for 1 cabbage amounts to 40 * 170 = Ksh. 6,800 
- For case 2 with mycorrhizal inoculant, the cabbage was sold at ksh.80 for 1 cabbage which amounts to 80*170 = Ksh. 13,600 
- CBR or cost-benefit ratio = Total benefit/  Total cost

**Return On Investment (ROI)**

Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of several different investments. It is calculated as the ratio of profit to total costs, expressed as a percentage. 

The formula for ROI is:

**ROI = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100**

- ROI quantifies the efficiency and profitability of mycorrhizal inoculation.

- Comparing both cases demonstrates the economic viability of integrating mycorrhizal fungi in cabbage production.

- Findings provide actionable insights for smallholder farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers.
  
-----

This analysis provides evidence-based recommendations for smallholder farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers by quantifying the trade-offs between upfront input costs and long-term productivity gains. The use of mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated enhanced profitability, improved soil health, and greater resilience, critical components for scaling sustainable agriculture in developing economies.

-------

## **Conclusion**
 
- The project bridges agronomic innovation and economic evaluation, showing that biological soil enhancers like mycorrhizal fungi can boost productivity and profitability.

- Results align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly zero hunger and climate-resilient agriculture.

- Combining empirical plant data with cost-benefit analysis contributes evidence-based recommendations for scaling sustainable agriculture in Africa..
