## Project Overview
This project evaluates the impact of **mycorrhizal fungi inoculation** on cabbage (*Brassica oleracea*), focusing on **sustainable farming practices and economic viability**. Biological soil amendments are tested to improve **growth, resilience, and profitability**, supporting smallholder farmers and national food security.

---

## Project Aim
Investigate the **agronomic and economic benefits** of mycorrhizal inoculation to enhance **productivity, resource efficiency, and sustainability** in smallholder agriculture.

---

## Objectives
- Measure changes in **root length, thickness, and biomass**.  
- Compare **health and growth rates** between treated and untreated plants.  
- Conduct **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** to assess economic feasibility.

---

## Methodology

### Experimental Design
- **Treatment Group:** Cabbages with mycorrhizal inoculant.  
- **Control Group:** Cabbages without inoculant.  
- **Plot Size:** 10m × 6m, producing 170 cabbage heads per plot.  

### Agronomic Inputs
- Mycorrhizal inoculant (biological soil enhancer)  
- Oshothane Ridomil (fungicide)  
- Booster (foliar nutrient)  
- Duduthrin (pesticide)

## Key Findings
- Treated plants showed **enhanced root growth**, nutrient uptake, and structural stability.  
- Plants with inoculant exhibited **better health, darker foliage, and pest resistance**.  
- Results suggest **greater resilience and productivity** under sustainable farming practices.

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

**Economic Scenarios**  
1. Control Group – no inoculant  
2. Treatment Group – with inoculant  

**Methodology**
- Input costs collected via structured checklists  
- Analysis performed in **Microsoft Excel**  
- **Key Metrics:** Input costs, market value, gross margin per m², **ROI**

## Economic Insights

**Cost of Production**

- Case 1 (no inoculant): 170 × Ksh. 40 = **Ksh. 6,800**  
- Case 2 (with inoculant): 170 × Ksh. 80 = **Ksh. 13,600**  
- **Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR):** Total benefit ÷ Total cost  

**CBR Comparison**

**Return on Investment (ROI)**

- ROI = (Profit ÷ Total Cost) × 100

- ROI shows **profitability of mycorrhizal inoculation**.  
- Comparison highlights **economic advantage of treatment**.  
- Provides **actionable insights** for smallholder farmers and policymakers.

## Key Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Priorities (High Impact)
- **Revenue doubling (KES 6,800 → 13,600 per farmer)** supports the case for targeted input subsidies to accelerate technology adoption.  
- **Demonstration plots** are essential for farmer buy-in, as visual proof of improved crop health drives trust and uptake.  
- **Extension officer training** is required to ensure correct application, maximize yield gains, and avoid misuse.



### Economic Rationale
- **2× market price premium (KES 80 vs KES 40 per head)** creates a powerful incentive for farmers to adopt the technology.  
- **Return-on-Investment (ROI) evidence** strengthens the case for farmer credit and input-financing products.  
- **Lower pest and disease pressure** reduces long-term production costs, improving farm profitability and resilience.



### Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Alignment
- **SDG 1 – No Poverty:** Doubling of smallholder farm income potential.  
- **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger:** Higher productivity strengthens food availability and stability.  
- **SDG 13 – Climate Action:** Improved drought tolerance and soil health enhance climate resilience.



### Critical Success Factors
- **Reliable input supply chains** must be established to avoid adoption bottlenecks.  
- **Quality certification systems** are needed to protect and sustain price premiums.  
- **Gender-inclusive targeting** ensures equitable development impact.  
- **Multi-location field validation** is required before national-scale rollout.

---

## Conclusion
- Mycorrhizal inoculation **enhances productivity and profitability**, bridging agronomy and economic evaluation.  
- Supports **SDGs**, including zero hunger and climate-resilient agriculture.  
- Combines empirical plant data with CBA to provide **evidence-based recommendations** for sustainable farming in Kenya.
